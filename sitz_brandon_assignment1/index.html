    <h1>School Life</h1>
    <P>
        I began attending Austin Peay in 2019. I am majoring in computer science with a 
        concentration in software engineering and a minor in mathematics. I am currently a 
        senior and looking forward to graduation. Computer science has been extremely difficult,
        but I've made it this far with <b>A LOT</b> of hard work and determination.
    </P>

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <P>
        My hobbies include playing the guitar, music, video games, and programming.
        I am in the process of teaching myself <i>python</i>. I like the readability of the
        language and the convenient functionality of dictionaries.
    </P>

    <h1>Career</h1>
    <P>
        I graduated high school back in 2012. I enlisted in the Air Force right after graduation.
        I spent six and a half years in and I was stationed at Minot AFB, ND. I separated in 
        March of 2019 and began attending Austin Peay in the fall semester. I work part time 
        as a delivery driver for Domino's.
