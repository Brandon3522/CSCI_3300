        I began attending Austin Peay in 2019. I am majoring in computer science with a 
        concentration in software engineering and a minor in mathematics. I am currently a 
        senior and looking forward to graduation. Computer science has been extremely difficult,
        but I've made it this far with <b>A LOT</b> of hard work and determination.
