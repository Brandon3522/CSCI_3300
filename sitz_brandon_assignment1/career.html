      I graduated high school back in 2012. I enlisted in the Air Force right
      after graduation. I spent six and a half years in and I was stationed at
      Minot AFB, ND. I separated in March of 2019 and began attending Austin
      Peay in the fall semester. I work part time as a delivery driver for
      Domino's.
